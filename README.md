# Solar Tracker

This page provides information about the project developed at UTFPR, Brazil, called Solar Tracker. Experiments were carried out in practice in a laboratory testbed, and the data contained in this Github repository were collected in those experiments. The paper ["Low-cost dual-axis solar tracker with photovoltaic energy processing for education"](http://www.anvargas.com/blog) describes the details of this experiment.
